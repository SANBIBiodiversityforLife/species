It is considered here as a separate species following Wieczorek <em>et al.</em> (2000, 2001). It should be noted that the taxonomic relationships within this superspecies are still far from settled. Members of this superspecies, which consists of a large number of forms that are distributed, generally allopatrically, throughout the tropical African savanna, have a common morphology, voice and ecology, but with widely differing dorsal patterns. Laurent (1983) concluded that the concept of one species best expressed present knowledge, and A. Schiøtz (pers. comm.) agrees with this. Wieczorek <em>et al.</em> (2001) carried out an analysis based on mtDNA, and separated the forms that they examined into 10 species. However, they examined only 22 out of 45 recognized ""subspecies"". The following distinct forms were not treated in the analysis by Wieczorek <em>et al.</em> (2001) and therefore cannot be allocated to any their ten species: <em>spatzi, pallidus, pachydermus, destefanii, variabilis, coerulescens, karissimbiensis, francoisi, sheldricki, rubripes, mwanzae, reesi, bitaeniatus, rhodoscelis, nyassae, taeniatus, insignis, alborufus, epheboides, aposematicus</em> and <em>broadleyi</em>. An un-named form from Marsabit in northern Kenya also cannot be allocated within the Wieczorek <em>et al.</em> (2001) arrangement of species. The arrangement currently followed by the Global Amphibian Assessment is provisional, pending a more complete analysis of the relationships within the <em>Hyperolius viridiflavus</em> superspecies. A. Schiøtz (pers. comm.) considers that it would have been prefereable for the Global Amphibian Assessment to treat the <em>Hyperolius viridiflavus</em> superspecies as a single species, because under this arrangement, all the described forms are covered unambiguously. Pickersgill (2007) described <em>Hyperolius fumatus</em> as a new species, but we follow Frost (2007) Amphibian Species of the World 5.1 http://research.amnh.org/herpetology/amphibia/index.php in treating it as a synonym of <em>H. marmoratus</em>.
