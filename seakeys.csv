They usually swim close to the surface but can be found to depths of 85m (Collette et al. 2011).Juveniles are also pelagic and are often associated with flotsam and can sometimes drift into large embayments where their cryptic colouring provides good camouflage (Smith and Heemstra 1991, van der Elst 1993, Ditty et al. 1994). Larvae are widely distributed in neritic and oceanic waters primarily near the surface (Collette et al. 2011) usually at temperatures greater than 24°C and offshore beyond the 50m depth isobath (Shcherbachev 1973, Rose and Hassler 1974, Ditty et al. 1994.

Only two pups survive per litter due to this cannibalistic behavior, and gestation is 9-12 months (Bass <em>et al</em>. 1975, Grant <em>et al</em>. 1983).

The only external way to distinguish an adult female from a juvenile is by the presence of mating scars on the pectoral fins.  (Kitchen-Wheeler, 2010; Marshall and Bennett, 2010; Marshall,<em> et al</em>., 2009).</p>","<p>It is thought that the reef manta is more resident to tropical waters and may exhibit smaller home ranges, philopatric movement patterns and shorter seasonal migrations than the Giant Manta Ray (Homma <em>et al</em>. 1999, Dewar <em>et al</em>. 2008, Kitchen-Wheeler 2010, Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2011, Deakos <em>et al.</em> 2011, Marshall <em>et al. </em>2011). Residency is thought to be related to areas of high primary productivity such as upwelling events, which may vary in time and space. Site fidelity to specific areas may also vary by sex and age-class. Seasonal migrations in this species likely correspond with cycles in productivity (Anderson<em> et al.</em> 2011, Couturier<em> et al.</em> 2011). Individuals have been recorded moving 500 km in one direction and up to 70km in a day (Homma <em>et al.</em> 1999, Kashiwagi <em>et al.</em> 2010, Kitchen-Wheeler 2010, Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2011, Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>The Reef Manta Ray (Manta alfredi) has a circumtropical and sub-tropical distribution, existing in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Within this broad range, however, actual populations appear to be sparsely distributed and highly fragmented. This is likely due to the specific resource and habitat needs of this species. Thought to be a relatively long lived species as phot-databases have recorded sightings over 30 years (Ito 2000, Kashiwagi <em>et al. </em>2010). Because reef manta rays have the capacity to consume large quantities of plankton, they may have a top-down effect on the structure of the marine communities that they inhabit. Further studies of this possible aspect of their ecology are needed (Kitchen-Wheeler, 2010; Marshall,<em> et al.,</em> 2012). </p>","<p>Female mantas reach maturity at 8-10 years and are estimated to live to 40 years. Fecundity is extremely low and only a single pup is usually produced, although two are conceived occasionally (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2008, Marshall and Bennett 2010a). In southern Mozambique, the Reef Manta Ray gives birth in the austral summer period after a gestation period one year (Marshall and Bennett 2010). Reproductive periodicity in the Reef Manta Ray is commonly biennial (Deakos 2010, Kitchen-Wheeler 2010, Marshall and Bennett 2010) or longer (Ito 2000) in the wild.</p>","<p>Reef manta rays are planktivores, feeding exclusively on zooplankton. When feeding, their cephalic horns are extended and their swimming becomes more deliberate. Plankton is filtered using the ventrally located gill slits. Reef manta rays follow the tidal changes that concentrate zooplankton in shallower atoll channels, increasing feeding rates (Marshall and Bennett, 2010; Perrine 1999).</p>","<p>Australia (New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia); British Indian Ocean Territory (Chagos Archipelago); Cape Verde; Christmas Island; Cocos (Keeling) Islands; Cook Islands (Cook Is.); Djibouti; Egypt (Egypt (African part), Sinai); Fiji; French Polynesia (Society Is., Tuamotu); Guam; India (Andaman Is.); Indonesia (Bali, Jawa, Papua, Sulawesi); Japan (Nansei-shoto); Madagascar; Malaysia; Maldives; Marshall Islands; Micronesia, Federated States of ; Mozambique; New Caledonia; Northern Mariana Islands; Oman; Palau; Papua New Guinea (Bismarck Archipelago, North Solomons, Papua New Guinea (main island group)); Philippines; Saudi Arabia; Senegal; Seychelles (Seychelles (main island group)); South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal); Spain (Canary Is.); Sri Lanka; Sudan; Thailand; United States (Hawaiian Is.); Yemen</p>",Marine,,"<a href=""/content/jaine-fra-couturier-lie-weeks-sj-townsend-ka-bennett-mb-et-al-2012-cc-25"">Jaine FRA, Couturier LIE, Weeks SJ, Townsend KA, Bennett MB, et al.

They start off as male and later transform to female, however, they cannot self-fertilize. Prior to fertilisation, male teredinids release sperm into the water column.  When the female eggs come to contact with the sperm, fertilisation occurs. Fertilized eggs are brooded in the gills to reach the veliger stage (Fofonoff <em>et al.</em> 2003).<em> Lyrodus pedicellatus</em> releases its larvae as pediveligers (an advanced stage of the veliger), which spends only 2 to 24 hours in the plankton (Turner and Johnson 1971 cited by Fofonnoff <em>et al.</em>, 2003).

A few winter specimens from the northeast Atlantic had shed their gill rakers, indicating that they were not feeding during this period of low zooplankton abundance. It was suggested that Basking Sharks might rest in deep water in winter (Parker and Boeseman 1954), utilising food reserves in the large liver.

Only one female carrying an embryo has ever been recorded. This shark was said to have given birth to five live young and one stillborn all ranging from 1.5-2 m (4.5-6 ft) in length. The widely accepted theory is that the basking shark is ovoviviparous. The gestation period is 3 years or longer. It is also been proposed that they use a method of embryonic nutrition known as oviphagy, in which an embryo feeds on unfertilized eggs or other embryos within the uterus. It has been estimated that females reach sexual maturity between 12-16 years. A characteristic feature of the juvenile basking shark is the long, hook-like snout. It is thought that this snout is useful in feeding in the womb and early feeding after birth by increasing water flow through the mouth. The mouth changes its shape and relative length rapidly during the first year after birth (Knickle <em>et al. </em>2016).</p>","<p>UnknownThey feed on small fish, fish eggs and zooplankton by swimming open-mouthed with gill rakers erect and extended across the gaps between the gill arches to form a sieve. The basking shark is the only species that relies solely the passive flow of water through its pharynx by swimming. The basking shark is usually seen swimming with its mouth wide open, taking in a continuous flow of water. Food is strained from the water by gill rakers located in the gill slits.

They have a crown of 12-20 gray, green, or brown radioles, pinnulate branchiae that they extrude from the tube opening to filter-feed (Costello<em> et al</em>., 2001; Luppi & Bas, 2002; Shumka <em>et al</em>., 2014).</p>",<p>Unknown</p>,"<p>Reefs of <em>F.</em> <em>enigmaticus </em>provide habitat for crabs, amphipods, polychaetes, gastropods, bryozoans, diatoms and incrusting green algae (Luppi & Bas, 2002).

The mantle musculature usually consists, on each side, of 6 longitudinal bundles, 4 converging to the branchial siphon and 2 to the atrial, but the number and arrangement of the bundles may be sometimes variable in some degree. The size of pharyngeoepicardiac openings varies from minute to rather extensive, though this is partly due to artifact at fixation. Rigidity of the test may be seemingly due mainly to its hardened thin surface layer, while the inner part is retaining more or less gelatinous consistency. Tentacles are usually well developed, ranging in number from approximately two dozens to 70 or more in larger specimens.

Population outbreaks of this species have caused substantial biofouling problems for aquaculture operations in South Africa, New Zealand, Chile and Scotland. Mussel raft culture in South Africa had significant long-term negative impacts on the benthic environment due to the fouling community being dominated by <em>C. intestinalis </em>which weighed more than the cultured mussel (Carver <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>","<p>Spawning and subsequent recruitment of <em>C. intestinalis </em>have been found to be dependent on light and temperature (Vercaemer <em>et. al.,</em> 2011).<em> C. intestinalis</em> is a solitary tunicate, with a short-lived planktonic stage before settling on a suitable substrate during metamorphosis and becoming a sessile filter feeder (Carver<em> et al.</em> 2006; Patanasatienkul <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>",<p><em>C. intestinalis</em> is a sessile filter-feeder which is typically observed attached to hard natural or artificial substrates by short projections of the tunic (villi) (Carver <em>et al. </em>2006; Patanasatienkul <em>et al. </em>2014). </p>,"<p>According to Carver <em>et al. </em>(2006), <em>C. intestinalis</em> currently occurs all around the coasts of Britain and the Netherlands.

According to (Dybern, 1965), C. intestinalis is native to Northern Europe where it is found in the benthic habitat (rocky bottom, eelgrass).<strong>Impacts: </strong><em>C</em>.<em> intestinalis</em> is thought to have negative impacts in the abundance of microzooplankton. <em>Ciona intestinalis</em> was reported to have preyed directly on oyster larvae and inhibited oyster settlement by covering and thereby reducing the amount of free substrate available for attachment. In South Africa, problems with <em>C. intestinalis </em>biofouling forced one company to completely re-sleeve their mussel inventory immediately after the main recruitment event. With its high fecundity and ability to reproduce rapidly (Carver <em>et al.</em> 2006), a mussel sock can be covered with <em>C. intestinalis</em> individuals in a short time; increasing the biomass on the mussel socks and resulting in mussel mortality through fall-off (Patanasatienkul <em>et al.</em> 2014) . Prior to the introduction of <em>C. intestinalis</em> these rivers were dominated by <em>S. clava</em>, but this species has virtually disappeared with the increasing infestation by <em>C. intestinalis</em> (Ramsay <em>et al</em>, 2009; Blum <em>et al</em>, 2007; Daigle & Herbinger 2009; Locke <em>et al,</em> 2007; Locke <em>et al</em>, 2009). <strong>Vectors:</strong><em>C. intestinalis</em> is believed to have been spread widely throughout all temperate regions by shipping activities, particularly as a hitchhiker on the hulls of vessels. In South Africa, it occurs as a fouling organism in Table Bay Harbour and has been cited as a major problem for mussel operations in Saldahna Bay (Carver <em>et. al.,</em> 2006). The large effective population size, broadcast-spawning nature and the relatively long free larval phase of 1-5 days compared with other tunicates indicate that <em>Ciona intestinalis </em>might have a high potential for natural dispersal, according to Zhan <em>et. al.</em>,2010.<strong>Control measures: </strong>Carver <em>et al</em>., (2006) found that in laboratory trials the rock crab (<em>Cancer irroratus</em>) was very efficient at cutting open and extracting the body tissues of <em>C. intestinalis</em>. Acetic acid treatment was found to be the most effective, achieving 95% <em>C. intestinalis</em> mortality but also resulted in the death of shellfish. More recently, trials in Chile have determined that the native grazing rock shrimp <em>Rhyncocinetes typus</em> could be a potential candidate for biological control of <em>C. intestinalis</em> (IUCN, 2010).
